The Energy-Efficient Task Scheduler is designed with the core objective of optimizing system performance while minimizing energy consumption. By intelligently managing task allocation, prioritization, and execution based on real-time workload and power metrics, the scheduler ensures that resources are used efficiently without compromising speed or reliability.

Functionalities 

Dynamic workload balancing to avoid energy waste

Prioritization algorithms that align with energy-saving goals

Sleep and wake mechanisms for idle components

Adaptive scheduling based on system behavior and power profiles

Objective: The primary goal is to strike a balance between computational efficiency and energy savingsâ€”critical for extending battery life in portable devices, reducing operational costs in data centers, and supporting sustainability in computing.

Overall, this scheduler contributes to greener computing by reducing the energy footprint of digital systems while maintaining high performance, making it a vital tool for modern, eco-conscious technology environments.
